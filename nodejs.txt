01.- require
------------------------------------------
    Resolving: To find the absolute path of the file.
    Loading: To determine the type of the file content.
    Wrapping: To give the file its private scope. This is what makes both the require and module objects local to every file we require.
    Evaluating: This is what the VM eventually does with the loaded code.
    Caching: So that when we require this file again, we donâ€™t go over all the steps another time.
